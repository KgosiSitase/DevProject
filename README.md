# iTunes Search Application

## Description

The iTunes Search Application is a web-based tool that allows users to search for various types of media on iTunes. Users can search for items such as music, movies, podcasts, TV shows, and more. The application fetches data from the iTunes Search API and displays the results in a user-friendly manner. Additionally, users can create a temporary favorites list by adding and removing items, though this list is not persisted when the application is closed.

## Purpose

Whether you're looking for the latest album by your favorite artist, a popular podcast, or a classic movie, this app makes it easy to find what you're looking for.
